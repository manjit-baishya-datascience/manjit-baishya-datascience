<!-- My Work -->
<h1>My Work 🎓</h1>
<h4>
  I have been working on <code>Data Science</code> projects and I have neatly organised them in the <a href="https://github.com/manjit-baishya-datascience/INDEX">INDEX</a>.
  <br>The Index itself has various sections where I have briefly described about the projects.
  <br>Each project has a repository of its own where the projects and its related work has been
  <br>published in descriptive manner.
  
  <br>I am an ECE Student and so I have also been working on some
<code>Embedded Systems and IOT</code> based
<br>projects. I aim to make a few contributions to the field of <code>Embedded Machine Learning</code> or <code>TinyML</code>.
<br>I have catalogued all the projects in <a href="https://github.com/manjit-baishya-embedded-systems-and-iot/manjit-baishya-embedded-systems-and-iot">here</a>. I am also working on a few <code>Web and App Development</code> projects which have been catalogued in a similar manner in <a href="https://github.com/manjit-baishya-development">here</a>.
